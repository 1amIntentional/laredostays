Jairo's place is not the newest or the most spacious, but it was solid in every way, and well worth what I paid. Clean, amenities as advertised, Jairo was super-responsive and the area is quiet and safe. I would definitely consider staying at Jairo's location on a return trip to Laredo...definitely recommend."

Chuy is the most adorable thing that exists, if his little Bluey fans are going to love him as much as my little one; he admits pets and is friendly with them. It is a love with children. Our stay was very enjoyable, the place was excellent. Going forward it will always be our preferred place in Laredo."

The house is very comfortable and well-equipped; it made us feel right at home from the moment we arrived. Plus, the location is excellent ‚Äì literally '100' ‚Äì with stores like Target, HEB and Starbucks just around the corner. Jairo was an exceptional host. He answered all our questions very quickly and even came in person to help us with the TV. We were really impressed by their dedication and kindness."
